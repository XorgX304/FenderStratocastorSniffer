The Fender Stratocastor sends input to the Xbone Wireless Adapter through wifi.

By Sniffing those packets, we can listen to the inputs the guitar is sending and interprete those input ourselves, simulating keyboard input.

This way, we can register the keyboard keys as the controls for games like Guitar Hero and Clone Hero, while still using the guitar.
